# EconomicShoppingGuide
•	For online shopping, we could hardly find websites that help online customers to find out the right product at the right place (available trustworthy online shopping portal), right time and with reasonable price. Some of the available websites are shopping through Google, Yahoo, etc. But, the main problem of those existing systems is that, they only recommend limited online shopping portal to the customers. For instance, we searched for “Samsung Galaxy Tablet” and the Google shopping portal didn’t recommend Amazon and eBay where we could find good deals. 
•	In order to solve this problem and help customers to find the best deals based on their personal requirements (Personalized Based Search), we have developed an efficient recommendation system for online shoppers. Our recommendation system (personalized shopping guide) uses the information provided by the user in order to search the best deals based on following concern of a user:
a)	Product Cost Concern
b)	Online Seller Concern 
c)	Product Quality Concern
d)	Shipping Time Concern
•	Whenever a user starts searching a product using our personalized search system, the system creates the dataset either by crawling websites on the internet or use the existing API to collect data from the websites. The system gathers information from the internet based on user defined requirement constraints.   
•	There are many things we need to consider while recommending products to the customer and some of them are information relevancy, Search Time, and User requirements.
•	We need a model to get the relevancy ranking of the extracted information with respect to the query. In order to do this, we have used Vector Space Model (VSM) as it allows ranking documents according to their possible relevance.
•	 We have implemented the project using JAVA.
